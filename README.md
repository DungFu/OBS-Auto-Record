# OBS-Auto-Record
Controls OBS to auto record specific games when they are running

To compile:
```
pyinstaller .\ObsAutoRecordWin.py --onefile --noconsole --icon=record_red.ico
```
and put the ico files in the same folder as the executable.

obs-websocket doesn't work yet on Mac, so the Mac version will not work currently.
